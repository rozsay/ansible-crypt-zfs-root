# Quick start

There is the way to install your dependencies:

  ansible-playbook  playbooks/requirements.yaml

Then you can test your remote host connections:
  
  ansible-playbook  playbooks/test_connection.yml

At this stage, if everything went well, you can run all other playbooks.


# Debug and developping

## Dump all variables from an host
